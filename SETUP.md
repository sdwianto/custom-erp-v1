# Simple POS - Development Setup

## Quick Fix for Loading Issue

The app is currently stuck in a loading state because Clerk authentication is not configured. Here are the solutions:

### Option 1: Quick Development Access (Recommended)
The app has been modified to allow development access without authentication. Simply:

1. Refresh your browser
2. Click "Go to Dashboard (Development)" on the home page
3. You can now access the app without authentication

### Option 2: Set up Clerk Authentication

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:
```env
# Clerk Authentication (Optional for development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here

# Database URL (Required)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

2. Get Clerk keys from https://clerk.com/
3. Restart the development server

### Option 3: Use Test Page
Visit `/test` to see system status and debug information.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Database commands
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run db:studio
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Next.js working
- ✅ React working  
- ✅ Tailwind CSS working
- ✅ TypeScript working
- ⚠️ Clerk authentication (optional for development)
- ⚠️ Database (needs setup)

The app will work in development mode without authentication configured.
